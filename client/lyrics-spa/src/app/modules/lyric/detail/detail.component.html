        <p class="subtitle-content-text">[Verse 1: Chris Martin] I've been reading books of old The legends and the myths Achilles and his gold Hercules and his gifts Spiderman's control And Batman with his fists And clearly I don't see myself upon that list [Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
            But she said, where'd you wanna go? How much you wanna risk? I'm not looking for somebody With some superhuman gifts Some superhero Some fairytale bliss Just something I can turn to Somebody I can kiss [Bridge: Chris Martin] I want something
            just like this Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo Oh, I want something just like this Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo [Chorus: Chris Martin] Oh, I want something just
            like this I want something just like this [Verse 2: Chris Martin] I've been reading books of old The legends and the myths The testaments they told The moon and its eclipse And Superman unrolls A suit before he lifts But I'm not the kind of
            person that it fits [Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin] She said, where'd you wanna go? How much you wanna risk? I'm not looking for somebody With some superhuman gifts Some superhero Some fairytale bliss Just something I can turn to Somebody I can
            miss [Chorus: Chris Martin] I want something just like this I want something just like this [Bridge: Chris Martin] Oh, I want something just like this Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo Oh, I want something
            just like this Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo [Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin] Where'd you wanna go? How much you wanna risk? I'm not looking for somebody With some superhuman gifts Some superhero Some fairytale
            bliss Just something I can turn to Somebody I can kiss I want something just like this [Chorus: Chris Martin] Oh, I want something just like this Oh, I want something just like this Oh, I want something just like this Oh, I want something
            just like this</p>
